# FEC Aggregation

Scripts for processing raw FEC data (particularly ActBlue/WinRed filings) and aggregating it based on some points of interest. Initially working on donor overlaps.

For now, we're just going to work with already-processed filings from [ActBlue](https://projects.propublica.org/itemizer/committee/C00401224/2022)/[WinRed](https://projects.propublica.org/itemizer/committee/C00694323/2022) in CSV format, from ProPublica's [FEC Itemizer](https://projects.propublica.org/itemizer). In the future, depending on needs around completeness or expediency, or what we're looking at, we can look at processing raw `.fec` files.
