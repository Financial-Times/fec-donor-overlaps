# Scripts

These scripts serve a variety of purposes in taking in raw datafiles from the FEC or ProPublica's FEC Itemizer and generating consolidated donor files and overlap files.

The `process_data.sh` bash script can be used as a guide for execution order and for understanding the purpose of each script. All of the data that the scripts interface with is in the sibling `data` directory.
